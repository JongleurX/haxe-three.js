* Install
: haxelib install three.js
* Dev install
: git clone git@github.com:labe-me/haxe-three.js.git
: zip -r haxe-three.js.zip haxe-three.js
: haxelib test haxe-three.js.zip
: haxelib dev three.js `pwd`/haxe-three.js
* Usage

Regular usage will embed three.js minified javascript:

: haxe -lib three.js ...

Debug compilation will embed non-minified javascript (easier to debug):

: haxe -lib three.js -debug ...

To avoid embedding javascript (don't forget to include three.js javascript manually inside your HTML):

: haxe -lib three.js -DnoEmbedJS ...

* Todo list
** TODO Test api
** TODO Integrate RequestAnimationFrame
** TODO Integrate Stats
** TODO More work on Collada API part
** TODO More TODOs in Three.hx
* Notes
Haxe modify some javascript prototypes and create a few incompatibilites.

Here's a list of things to care:

- Array prototype is modified which affect the "for v in someArray" javascript behaviour
- Date.now is overriden by haxe, the new method returns a Date object instead of the regular time stamp
